# Hi, I’m Elena Tarasova

### 🤖 UX-focused AI training specialist | Multilingual data designer | Prompt-aware annotation strategist

I build data systems that help LLMs and healthcare teams understand what humans *mean* — not just what they say.

## What I do

- Design **UX-first annotation pipelines** for AI training data  
- Build **multilingual, token-aware, culturally sensitive** frameworks  
- Create tools & methods for **prompt-driven, human-in-the-loop annotation**  
- Prototype scalable, stress-aware interfaces for **public health** and **AI**  
- Align **LLM behavior** with real-world user logic and context
