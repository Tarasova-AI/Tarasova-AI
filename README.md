# 👋 Hi, I’m Elena Tarasova

### 🤖 UX-focused AI training specialist | Multilingual data designer | Prompt-aware annotation strategist

I build annotation frameworks that help LLMs learn what humans mean — not just what they say.

---

## 🧠 What I do

- Design **UX-first annotation pipelines** for AI training data
- Create **multilingual, token-aware** content systems
- Build tools & guides for **prompt-driven, human-in-the-loop annotation**
- Align **LLM behavior** with actual user intent and meaning

## 📦 My open framework for annotation

I’m the author of the [AI-ready Annotation Framework](https://github.com/elenatarasova/ai-annotation-framework):

> 8 structured modules to scale, review, and align annotation for LLMs — with UX logic, QA layers, multilingual workflows, and semi-automation via prompts.

## ⚡ What drives me

To design data that thinks like a model — and respects how humans feel.
