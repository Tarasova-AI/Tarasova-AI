### 🤖 UX-focused AI training specialist | Multilingual data designer | Prompt-aware annotation strategist

I build data systems that help LLMs and healthcare teams understand what humans *mean* — not just what they say.

## 🧠 What I do

- Design **UX-first annotation pipelines** for AI training data
